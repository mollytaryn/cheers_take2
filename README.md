# cheers_take2
The ruby cheers exercise (see elizabrock/cheers), this time 3 weeks into learning Ruby, with tests!

##Instructions

##Specifications
Start the program by running `./cheers.rb`

The program should ask:

> "Hello! What is your name?"

The user types in their name, for example:

> Molly

The program outputs a cheer in the following format:

> Give me an... M
> Give me an... O
> Give me an... L
> Give me an... L
> Give me a... Y
> Molly’s just GRAND!

* Follow the phonetic grammatical rules for a and an.
* Strip out all special characters (i.e. non-word characters) in "Give me a" section of the cheer.
* Print the user's name out as it was originally input for the "just GRAND" line
* If there was no input, ask again, until valid input provided

After printing out the user's cheer, the program asks:

> Hey, Molly, what's your birthday? (mm/dd)

The user types in their birthdate

> 08/19

The program then outputs the number of days until the user's birthday.

Awesome!  Your birthday is in 45 days! Happy Birthday in advance!

You’re going to have to use the Ruby Docs.
